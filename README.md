# CIFAR10_Image_Classification


The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The dataset is organized into five training batches and one test batch. Each training batch contains 10,000 images, with potential imbalances in class distribution, but collectively ensuring 5,000 images per class. The dataset serves as a benchmark for image classification algorithms, providing a diverse set of real-world images for training and evaluation. Researchers use the training images to optimize models, and the test set to assess generalization. The randomized order of images in training batches promotes robust feature recognition, contributing to models' ability to generalize effectively. Overall, CIFAR-10 facilitates the development and evaluation of image classification systems.
